# About

**What is DevExp (or simply “dx”)?**
DevExp is a powerful cloud-native platform with a command-line interface (CLI) that brings together a suite of tools designed to make developers faster, more focused, and radically more productive.

Born from years of hands-on experience in software engineering, `dx` merges best practices, everyday workflows, and automation into a single, unified developer experience. Think of it as your all-in-one command center for prototyping, testing, showcasing, and deploying your projects — faster than ever.

---

***✅ Already included in early prototypes:***

- 🌐 HTTP tunnel management
- 🧑‍💻 Git profile switching and management
- 🔐 Environment variable & secret storage
- ⚙️ Process & workflow automation

Our mission is to bring together the essential tools developers use daily, into a single connected ecosystem — replacing dozens of fragmented apps, cloud services, and a trillion subscriptions (yes, we’re looking at you, subscription hell).
